# orikaobjectmapper - This project uses Orika - The object to Object mapper framework.
If the Source/ Target object is nested or has collections, it is more difficult in copying the properties from source to target.

Ofcourse, we can serialize or deserialize the objects OR we can copy using reflections OR we can iterate the source object and "set" it on 
the target object.

But this jar does this gracefully.
